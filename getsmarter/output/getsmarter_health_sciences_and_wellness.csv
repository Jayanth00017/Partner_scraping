Child Development: Behavior and Mental Health,Course,"[<p><p>It’s well known that childhood plays a significant role in the shaping of physically and mentally healthy adults. Positive social, environmental, and behavioral factors can contribute towards a child thriving in later life. However, not all children are the same: each requires a unique approach, and it’s imperative that the role of individual identity development within supportive environments is recognized. </p><p>Study child psychology from this important perspective in the Child Development: Behavior and Mental Health online short course, designed by child development experts from the Stanford Center for Health Education (SCHE), part of Stanford Medicine. By capitalizing on each child’s personal interests and motivations, you'll learn to create a space that fosters positive interactions and optimal learning. Over the course of six weeks, you’ll look at practical, science-based approaches to encourage a child’s innate learning abilities, and positive behavioral discipline techniques to prevent and address children acting out. You’ll also explore the impact of parenting and grasp the importance of a child’s social connection with adults and peers. Lastly, the course examines the steps you can take to support a child’s mental health, in order to help them develop in a healthy and happy way. </p></p>, <p>It’s well known that childhood plays a significant role in the shaping of physically and mentally healthy adults. Positive social, environmental, and behavioral factors can contribute towards a child thriving in later life. However, not all children are the same: each requires a unique approach, and it’s imperative that the role of individual identity development within supportive environments is recognized. </p>, <p>Study child psychology from this important perspective in the Child Development: Behavior and Mental Health online short course, designed by child development experts from the Stanford Center for Health Education (SCHE), part of Stanford Medicine. By capitalizing on each child’s personal interests and motivations, you'll learn to create a space that fosters positive interactions and optimal learning.

</p></p>, <p>The consequences of stress are becoming increasingly apparent – not just to the individual, but to organizations as a whole. Stress causes 56 percent of workers to search for a new job, resulting in high turnover costs and productivity losses.<sup>1</sup> As the interdependent relationship between personal well-being and team productivity is realized, businesses are beginning to prioritize wellness for the resilience and benefits it brings.<br/></p>, <p>The <strong>Employee Wellness and Stress Management</strong> online short course focuses on the impact you can have when you take the steps to improve your own, as well as others, health. Developed by Dr. Grace Gengoux from the <a href=""https://healtheducation.stanford.edu/"" target=""_blank"">Stanford Center for Health Education</a>, you’ll gain strategies to support the self-care of the teams you lead and colleagues you influence, while also focusing on your own well-being and personal resilience. With this dual approach, you’ll explore the reciprocal relationship between a ‘healthy you’ and ‘healthy teams’ as you unpack the science and practical examples of self-care. With an understanding of how essential physical health practices are for stress and energy management, you’ll gain the tools and techniques to encourage well-being of self and others. The course uses self-reflection, goal setting, and global case studies to guide you as you define your wellness priorities, and build resilience for a fast-paced and complex working world.
