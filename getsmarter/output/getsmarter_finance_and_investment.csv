This allows trading algorithms to find market efficiencies and better recognise profitable patterns of their own accord, making trades at a very high frequency. The performance of these algorithms, therefore, often exceeds those of professional traders and financial advisors.</p>, <p>This online programme from Oxford Saïd aims to equip you with a comprehensive understanding of the rules that drive successful algorithmic trading strategies and hedge funds, as well as a grounded introduction to financial theory and behavioural finance. Over the course of six weeks, you’ll learn four principles established by Programme Director Nir Vulkan, to guide you through the process of evaluating an algorithmic trading model. You’ll also discover what biases are present in the market and how these behavioural traits create exploitable patterns.

</p>, <p>In today’s shifting business landscape, a functional understanding of finance and accounting has become an integral part of any influential manager’s toolkit. On the eight-week Accounting for Investment and Managerial Decision-Making online certificate course from the London School of Economics and Political Science (LSE), you’ll develop a financial and managerial accounting toolkit to drive decision-making and enhance organisational performance. With a firm grounding in accounting principles, you’ll improve your ability to analyse statements, and learn how to communicate financial results to key business stakeholders.
</p>, <p>With guidance from expert LSE faculty, you’ll discover how insights into your company’s costs, efficiencies, and profits can help create a culture of sustained improvement, and learn how delegating decision-making authority can foster a sense of responsibility in your team. Finally, you’ll assess the role of planning, budgeting, and performance targets, and explore how to design incentive, monitoring, and feedback systems that can achieve them.
</p>, <p><em>Please note this course is geared towards non-financial managers and professionals from a broad range of industries and business areas. Prior knowledge of accounting is not required or expected.</em>
