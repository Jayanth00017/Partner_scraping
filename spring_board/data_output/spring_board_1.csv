Grounded in empathy and a hands-on, iterative approach to problem solving, design thinking is the mindset you’ll use to create effective user experiences. The key aspects of design thinking include:

Empathy: observe and engage the people you’re designing a product for
Problem definition: a good solution depends on addressing the right problem
Ideation: a good solution depends on addressing the right problem through divergent and convergent thinking, consider many possible solutions
Prototyping: test those possible solutions
Testing: get feedback from real people that will help you improve your ideas and create solutions

User research is central to UX design. When you understand the needs and pain points of your target users, you’ll be able to craft problem-focused solutions. There are many different user research tools; this section will explore the most effective of them.
Topics include: user research methods, research plans, recruiting users through screener surveys, diary studies, and interviews.

Understanding the data you collect during the research phase will help you to make decisions that will reflect the needs of your users. In this unit, you’ll learn the different methods you can use to synthesize research in order to keep your designs focused on your user.

Topics include: synthesis best practices, thematic analysis, affinity maps, empathy maps, personas, jobs to be done, problem statements, journey maps, and research presentations
This section (part of the UCD design phase) is all about getting your design hands dirty, so to speak. Here are some of the things you’ll dive into:

Brainstorming solutions to the problem you’re trying to solve (for your capstone project)
Learning how to write user stories
Learning the fundamentals of information architecture (to express your product's structure and flow)


Learn the fundamentals of accessibility in design
Become familiar with the role brand platform plays in UI design and visual communication
Understand the purpose and use of design systems and style guide
Understand Material Design (Google) and Human Interface Design (Apple) guidelines
Develop a fluency in common product types
Become familiar with the common problems and design solutions for e-commerce, social media, message, data and dashboard design
Become familiar with comment and current UI patterns
Study successful, widely adopted designs

Visual skill takes time to develop and requires a lot of practice! To that end, you’ll be introduced to industry-standard design tools early on in order to complete UI exercises that have been woven throughout the course. These UI exercises are designed to help you build your visual skills, including how to evaluate designs as well as improve designs based on visual principles (such as balance, scale, alignment, hierarchy, and others).
In this section of the UCD design phase, you’ll bring your designs to life, first as sketches and then through wireframing. You’ll also be introduced to several design tools, including Sketch, Adobe XD, and Figma, learn how to conduct a guerilla usability test to validate your sketches, and learn how to apply interaction design principles to your designs.

Learn to build style guides and design your projects’ color palette, fonts, grid, iconography, UI elements, photography or imagery and illustration
Learn how to use grids in UI design
Design high fidelity screens in industry tools like Sketch, Adobe XD, and Figma
Design animations and interaction patterns for key UI elements
Create prototypes and learn when, why, and how to use different evaluative testing methods to continuously improve your product
Put together a comprehensive case study of your capstone journey and give a presentation about your project.
