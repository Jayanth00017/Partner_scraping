Grounded in empathy and a hands-on, iterative approach to problem solving, design thinking is the mindset you’ll use to create effective user experiences. The key aspects of design thinking include:

Empathy: observe and engage the people you’re designing a product for
Problem definition: a good solution depends on addressing the right problem
Ideation: a good solution depends on addressing the right problem through divergent and convergent thinking, consider many possible solutions
Prototyping: test those possible solutions
Testing: get feedback from real people that will help you improve your ideas and create solutions

Estimated time: 44+ HoursUser research is central to UX design. When you engage users and understand their experience, you can move from being aware of a problem to understanding why the problem exists and what users want to see resolved. There are many different user research tools; this section will explore the most effective of them.Topics include: user research methods, research plans, recruiting users through screener surveys, diary studies, and interviews.In this UCD discovery unit, you’ll work on some mini-projects to sharpen your user research skills and then apply those skills to your capstone project.
Estimated time: 10+ HoursUnderstanding the data you collect during the research phase will help you to make decisions that will reflect the interests of your users. In this unit, you’ll learn the different methods you can use to synthesize research in order to keep your designs focused on your user.Topics include: synthesis best practices, affinity maps, empathy maps, personas, problem statements, journey maps, and research presentations.
Estimated time: 16+ HoursThis section (part of the UCD design phase) is all about getting your design hands dirty, so to speak. Here are some of the things you’ll dive into:

Brainstorming solutions to the problem you’re trying to solve (for your capstone project)
Learning how to write and map user stories that capture the intent of personas
Learning the fundamentals of information architecture (to help you create and express your capstone project’s structure and flow)

Estimated time: 60+ HoursIn this section of the UCD design phase, you’ll bring your designs to life, first as sketches and then through wireframing. You’ll also be introduced to several design tools, including Sketch and Adobe XD, learn how to conduct a guerilla usability test to validate your sketches, and learn how to apply interaction design principles to your designs. You’ll also explore the world of user interface design in order to make your designs more accessible and engaging.
Estimated time: 9+ HoursIn the final phase of the UCD process, evaluation, you’ll create a prototype of your capstone project’s red routes. In this section, you’ll also learn when, why, and how to use different evaluative testing methods to improve your project. You’ll also put together a comprehensive case study of your capstone journey and give a presentation about your project.
Estimated time: 25+ HoursLike most creative professions, your work as a UX designer is often going to be interrupted by urgent, unexpected projects. Don’t worry, though—after working through this unit, you’ll be prepared! In this unit, you’ll use the design sprint process to sharpen your skills.You’ll work through:

A Hackathon-style project to practice working through a design sprint
End-to-end design while working under tight deadlines

Estimated time: 33+ HoursThis unit explores topics like psychology and empty states that will take your designs from good to great by teaching you how to craft designs that lead to increased engagement, continued use, and conversion.Topics include:

Onboarding flows
Empty states
Strategy and service design
