Creating an account and getting signed up is disturbing to say the least. I took a screenshot and showed it to a computer person and they agreed it was backwards. I think someone needs to go through the motions and see what the problem is which leads me to wonder why someone hasn't even tested this out. The content and videos so far are pretty good, however once a slide or module is done, you can't go back and watch it again. If you want to rewind, then it goes too fast and takes you to the next screen where you find out that you cannot go back in and review it again. Again, someone programmed this and never went thru the program as in program testing. Obviously this is my perception based on my experience so far. After 20 years of not doing much accounting, I am going thru the prerequisite now. I have had some questions so far, but who do you reach out to. If there is someone, then are these people really have the time to answer tons of questions not only coming from me but others. I'm actually going to have to pull out reading 22 of the CFA curriculum to brush up on accounting as this appears to provide more content than a rough sketch of what I am experiencing. Again, I'm only in the beginning stage of this. It may turn out that I did enjoy this program.
