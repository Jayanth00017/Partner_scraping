Creating an account and getting signed up is disturbing to say the least. I took a screenshot and showed it to a computer person and they agreed it was backwards. I think someone needs to go through the motions and see what the problem is which leads me to wonder why someone hasn't even tested this out. The content and videos so far are pretty good, however once a slide or module is done, you can't go back and watch it again. If you want to rewind, then it goes too fast and takes you to the next screen where you find out that you cannot go back in and review it again. Again, someone programmed this and never went thru the program as in program testing. Obviously this is my perception based on my experience so far. After 20 years of not doing much accounting, I am going thru the prerequisite now. I have had some questions so far, but who do you reach out to. If there is someone, then are these people really have the time to answer tons of questions not only coming from me but others. I'm actually going to have to pull out reading 22 of the CFA curriculum to brush up on accounting as this appears to provide more content than a rough sketch of what I am experiencing. Again, I'm only in the beginning stage of this. It may turn out that I did enjoy this program. Right now, I'm 50/50 on whether I made an informed decision with this purchase.",Salil Hillary,"AmazingIn one hour i was able to grasp Income Statement , Balance Sheet and Cash Flow Statement in Detail.

Having modelled multiple such models, I still learned quite a few tricks and was blown away by the preciseness and the cleanliness of this model.The only feedback I have is that your team could focus on breaking down complex calculations and formulas into smaller steps (lesser loops and complexity). This helps the analyst explain his model to the Fund Partners in a less time consuming manner. I used to have similar formula lines that took into nested loops and multiple formulas and everything was fine with it, although the CIO mentioned that he usually scans my financial models on the go and so he would love to spend lesser time wrt understanding line items by formulas. Hence, I believe even though one can do these complex calculations maybe in one cell (or even mentally), but one needs to break them out! This allows the end recipient / user of the model to understand your approach and the steps you've taken.Hope this helps.Cheers!",Orkun Icten,So beneficialI completed the program and I think that it is the best way to understand real estate financial modeling easily.
