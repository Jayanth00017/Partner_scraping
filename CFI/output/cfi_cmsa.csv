By introducing concepts linearly and logically, this course will first help you establish your knowledge of the portfolio management process by focusing on the firm-side, answering questions like – what are traditional versus non-traditional portfolio managers, what are their strategies, and what are their investment approaches. This knowledge will enable you to understand how portfolio managers differ from three key perspectives: stakeholders, risk tolerance, and investment goals. We then understand what portfolio managers in-role do by examining how portfolios are constructed, discussing how client mandates are formed, and last by not least, by demonstrating how a portfolio manager’s performance is measured. </span></p>",Key insights into the process and the role,  Trading strategies used in the finance and capital markets,|Hedge fund overview|Hedge fund structures|Performance measurement|Directional strategies|Arbitrage strategies|Event-driven strategies|,"['\nIntroduction and Course Roadmap\n', '\nDownload Course Presentation\n', '\nWhat Is Portfolio Management\n', '\nInteractive Exercise 1\n', '\nWhat Is Portfolio Management (Part 2)\n', '\nPortfolio Manager Strategies\n', '\nPortfolio Manager Strategies (Part 2)\n', '\nTypes of Portfolio Managers\n', '\nPortfolio Manager Approaches\n', '\nPortfolio Manager Profiles\n', '\nInvestment Manager Approaches\n', '\nTraditional vs. Non Traditional\n', '\nTraditional\n', '\nTraditional vs. Non-Traditional (Part 2)\n', '\nPortfolio Construction\n', '\nPortfolio Construction (Continued)\n', '\nPortfolio Construction - Efficient Frontier Primer\n', '\nInteractive Exercise 2\n', '\nPortfolio Construction - Efficient Frontier Exercise Debrief\n', '\nUnderstanding Client Mandates\n', '\nUnderstanding Client Mandates (Part 2)\n', '\nUnderstanding Client Mandates (Part 3)\n', '\nThe Efficient Frontier and the Impact of Constraints\n', '\nInteractive Exercise 3\n', '\nHow Fund Performance Is Measured\n', '\nHow Fund Performance Is Measured (Part 2)\n', '\nHow Fund Performance Is Measured (Part 3)\n', '\nPerformance Attribution\n', '\nPerformance Attribution (Part 2)\n', '\nWho Is Portfolio Management For\n', '\nWho Is Portfolio Management For (Part 2)\n\n', '\nQualified Assessment\n', '\nShare Your Feedback\n', '\nCourse Completion\n']",Intermediate , Work in capital markets| whether on the buy-side or the sell-side,John Ngelula,introduction to hedge fundsgood course,Gabriel Rosmeteniuc,Introduction to Hedge FundsIt is an amazing source of knowledge and helped a lot in having a better understanding about the industry.,VENUGOPAL RAJAMANURI,Introduction to hedge fundsGood content with easily understandable examples.
