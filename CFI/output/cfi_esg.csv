https://courses.corporatefinanceinstitute.com/courses/environmental-social-governance,Introduction to ESG,"<p>Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) has gained increasing attention over the past few years, with many institutional investors investing only in those companies that provide ESG performance reporting. In fact, ESG has considerations relevant to analysts and investors, consumers and employees, and has become a key topic of discussion at the Board table. Â This course provides an overview of an ESG framework and how it supports a companyâ€™s overall risk management. It examines each component in detail and provides insight into how they converge to impact a company and its stakeholders. The course also discusses how to look at corporate pressures &amp; stakeholder expectations and their impact on risk identification and business success. Lastly, we look at key considerations from both the company and investor perspectives, before applying theory to practice in a final case study.</p>","An overview of the Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) framework",,Explain what ESG is and its relevance to making financial decisions;,"['\nCourse Introduction\n', <span class=""label label-free"">
