Having modelled multiple such models, I still learned quite a few tricks and was blown away by the preciseness and the cleanliness of this model.The only feedback I have is that your team could focus on breaking down complex calculations and formulas into smaller steps (lesser loops and complexity). This helps the analyst explain his model to the Fund Partners in a less time consuming manner. I used to have similar formula lines that took into nested loops and multiple formulas and everything was fine with it, although the CIO mentioned that he usually scans my financial models on the go and so he would love to spend lesser time wrt understanding line items by formulas. Hence, I believe even though one can do these complex calculations maybe in one cell (or even mentally), but one needs to break them out! This allows the end recipient / user of the model to understand your approach and the steps you've taken.Hope this helps.Cheers!",Orkun Icten,So beneficialI completed the program and I think that it is the best way to understand real estate financial modeling easily.
