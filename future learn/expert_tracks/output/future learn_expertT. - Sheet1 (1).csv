By looking at context, progression, assessment, and learning outcomes, those involved in teaching science will develop approaches to improve engagement and encourage learning. The three courses build up teaching practice by using examples from biology, physics, and chemistry.</p>, <p>The question of how to engage students in science subjects goes wider than just schools. It is a matter of record that we are facing a global STEM skills gap. Developing practical and scientific skills with students throughout school will be key to addressing this skills gap in the near future.</p>, <p>Hands-on science allows students to better understand the connection between theory and practice. Using practical science experiments can make what students have learned in textbooks come to life. By involving students in the learning process, teachers can encourage active learning, and ultimately boost learning outcomes.</p>, <p>Teachers on this ExpertTrack will benefit from our CPD approach which emphasises reflecting on practice and trying out approaches in their own classroom whilst learning online.</p>, <p>You'll benefit from a peer-to-peer learning environment. Teachers can share their insights on how to engage students using practical science experiments with fellow professionals, exchanging advice and sharing best practice.</p>, <p>The practical work examples in this ExpertTrack are taken from the UK's GCSE curriculum.
